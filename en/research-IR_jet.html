				<h1>Supersonic jet infrared spectroscopy</h1>
				<article class="post">

				<p>
					　Our laboratory develops various dual wavelength spectroscopy using two or more lasers at the same time and aims at detailed elucidation of structures and reactive element processes of supersonic jet cooled molecules and solvated clusters. The supersonic jet method is a method of obtaining an extremely low temperature of 10 K or less by ejecting a high pressure rare gas and a sample from a pore of about 0.5 to 1 mm into a vacuum (Fig. 1).
				</p>

				<div>
					　Moreover, in supersonic jet method, each molecule becomes isolated state without becoming solid even at such extremely low temperature. Therefore, in practice, molecules that exist only in a state surrounded by a myriad of molecules can be placed in a state in which one molecule as depicted by so-called molecular formula exists alone. In addition, since the temperature is extremely low, it is possible to limit the influence by heat to the limit. Therefore, it is possible to measure properties unique to one molecule in an ideal environment. As an example, Fig. 2 shows the ultraviolet absorption spectrum of tyramine molecule.

				<img src="images/research-IR_2.png" style="max-width: 100%">
				<div>
					When measured in solution, only a smooth spectrum can be obtained due to the temperature and the solvent molecules around it, but you can see that infinitely many complex absorptions appear when measured in a supersonic jet. By analyzing these absorption, it becomes possible to obtain detailed information on the molecule.
				</div>

				<div>
					In addition, a supersonic jet creates a molecular aggregate called cluster in which several molecules aggregate (Fig. 3). Clusters can control the number of constituent molecules, and it is an interesting system that can observe how molecules are gathered to a certain molecule while increasing the number of molecules one by one. Clusters are considered to be solute molecules and only a fixed number of solvent molecules gathered in the gas phase and can be regarded as a so-called nanoscale solution, which is a part of solution / aggregation phase. In addition, since the influence by the change in the number of solvent molecules appears greatly, cluster-specific properties may appear. Since solvated clusters are closed in the system and molecular orientation is fixed, it is the ideal environment for studying the reactive element process.
				</div>

				<div>
			However, solvated clusters can only occur so far at supersonic molecular beams. Due to the extremely sparse concentration of molecules and clusters in supersonic jets, it is almost impossible to measure ordinary infrared absorption spectra.
				</div>
				<div>
				Infrared absorption light is one of the effective methods to investigate the structure and reaction of clusters. Infrared absorption appears by vibrating chemical bonds of molecules, and it is compared to "fingerprints of molecules" because it sharply reflects the structure and environment of the molecule. Therefore, if we can capture changes in the infrared spectrum during the reaction every moment, it will be a powerful tool to elucidate the reaction process.

					So I developed IR-UV-UV Dip spectroscopy (Figure 4). First, we excite molecules and clusters with the first ultraviolet laser (UV1), ionize them by irradiating the second ultraviolet laser (UV2), and detect the amount of molecules and clusters as ion signals. Before irradiating the first ultraviolet laser in this state, the wavelength is swept by irradiating with a tunable infrared laser (IR laser). When the wavelength of the infrared laser resonates with the vibration level of the cluster, molecules and clusters are excited and excited, then relaxed and dissociated, so the amount of ions in the cluster being detected decreases. Therefore, it can be measured as a decrease in the amount of ions detecting the infrared spectrum of molecules or clusters.

				　This method is extremely sensitive because it ionizes and detects a specific product, and it can easily measure infrared spectrum even in dilute molecular beams. Also, not only the infrared spectrum but also the visible / ultraviolet spectrum can be measured in the same way.

				<div class="col-md-12  col-lg-10 ">

						　　Figure 5 shows the infrared spectrum measured in the supersonic jet of Z-Serinemethylester and the infrared spectrum measured in solution. 。<br>
					We can see that extremely detailed infrared spectrum can be obtained by measuring in supersonic jet. <br>
						Although it can not be distinguished from the infrared spectrum of the solution, you can see that there are three stable structures by using supersonic jet method. 

						<br><br>
						　Furthermore, by changing the timing of infrared light incident, it is also possible to measure the excited state, the ionic state, and the infrared spectrum of the reaction intermediate.

				<div class="col-md-12 col-lg-10">
					<p>
					First, when infrared light is irradiated between the first ultraviolet laser (UV1) and the second ultraviolet laser (UV2), it becomes UV - IR - UV Dip spectroscopy (Fig. 6). Please note that timing of infrared light incidence is different from Figure 4. In the case of molecules or clusters where reaction occurs in the excited state, the cluster is photoexcited with the first ultraviolet laser (UV 1) to initiate the reaction and the final reaction product is ionized by the second ultraviolet laser (UV 2) and detected can do. Before irradiating the second ultraviolet laser in this state, the wavelength is swept by irradiating a tunable infrared laser (IR laser).
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 col-lg-10">
					<p>
						　　When the wavelength of the infrared laser resonates with the vibration level of the reaction intermediate, the intermediate is relaxed and dissociated by vibration excitation, so the amount of ions of the final product decreases. Therefore, it is possible to measure the infrared spectrum of the reaction intermediate. 
							<br>
						Furthermore, by changing the incoming timing (delay time) between UV1 and the IR laser, it is also possible to measure the infrared spectrum at any time from the start of the reaction. By doing this, it is possible to track the progress of chemical reaction every moment.
