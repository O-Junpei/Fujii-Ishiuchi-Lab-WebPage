							<p>　The phenolic molecule is the simplest aromatic alcohol having a hydroxyl group bonded to the aromatic ring, and it is known that its acidity is about six orders of magnitude higher than that of ordinary alcohol due to the resonance effect of the aromatic ring. Therefore, molecular clusters formed from phenol and polar molecules have been considered as a model system of acid-base reaction. In particular, phenol was considered to further increase acidity further by photoexcitation, and it was thought that it is about the same degree as strong acid such as hydrochloric acid. Therefore, in the excited state of these solvation clusters, the proton transfer reaction (that is, acid dissociation It is said that it causes a reaction).</p>
							<br />
							<p>　Among them, attention has been focused on clusters formed with ammonia molecules, which are highly basic solvents. Ammonia receives the protons, generates ammonium ions, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and can form stable salts with various positive ions. Therefore, it has been believed that photoexcitation of a phenol-ammonia cluster leads to acid dissociation of the OH group of the phenol and formation of a cluster composed of ammonium ion, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, phenolate ion, C <sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sup>-</sup> ( Figure 1). Many studies have been conducted in accordance with this assumption, but many of them included contradictions, and there were many states that have not been described satisfactorily for a long time.</p>
							<div class="center"><img src="images/research-PhOHNH3_1-3.png" width="100%" height="530" /></div>
							<br />
							<p>　Therefore, we tried to determine what the reactive organism is by applying infrared spectroscopy to reactive organisms generated after photoexcitation of phenol ammonia clusters. The result was surprising, it was completely different from the initially predicted NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>ion, and it coincided with the spectrum [1] of the neutral NH <sub>4</sub>radical and ammonia cluster 2). In other words, although phenol in the electronically excited state has been considered as an acid, it became clear that the OH group generates hydrogen atom radicals rather than protons (FIG. 3) [2].</p>
							<br />
							<p>　Therefore, in order to clarify the reaction dynamics of the hydrogen transfer reaction, UV - IR - UV Dip spectroscopy was performed with a picosecond wavelength tunable laser and the measurement of the picosecond time resolved infrared spectrum was also successful 4) [3]. This is the world's first time-resolved infrared spectrum of clusters that has been measured, and we have only succeeded yet. By analyzing the time change of this time resolved infrared spectrum, it was found that the radical cleavage of the OH group occurs at the phenol-ammonia <sub>3</sub>cluster after photoexcitation at 24 picoseconds. Furthermore, the generated ammonium radical reflects the structure of the cluster, and metastable NH<sub>4</sub>-NH<sub>3</sub>-NH<sub>3</sub>radicals are selectively generated (memory effect), and the metastable species is the most stable  NH 3 with a lifetime of 6 picoseconds <sub>3</sub>-NH<sub>4</sub>-NH<sub>3</sub>(Figure 5).</p>
							<div class="center"><img src="images/research-PhOHNH3_4-5.png" width="100%" height="450" /></div>
							<br />
							<p>　According to recent theoretical calculations, it is predicted that this radical cleavage is not unique to phenol and can occur in all molecules having OH, NH groups, etc. [4], not only phenol but also phenol derivatives and indoles etc. And examples have been found.</p>
							<br />
							<p>　This means that there is a possibility that we need to reexamine the conventional research examples interpreted that OH of the acidic molecule will give out protons. OH and NH groups are contained in a wide range of molecules including biomolecules such as DNA, and their photoexcitation reaction has a great influence on various fields. Currently, we have grown into research topics centered on researchers in France and Germany, and we are continuing our research aiming for further development.</p>
