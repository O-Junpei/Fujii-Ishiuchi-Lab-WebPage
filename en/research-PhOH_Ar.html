							Intermolecular forces are basic interactions when molecules are assembled together, and all molecular recognition systems that demonstrate advanced functions are all constructed by controlling intermolecular forces. The most typical example is the formation of nucleobase pairs, AT, GC in DNA. Hitherto, hydrogen bonding has been focused mainly as a binding mechanism of the base pair. However, with the progress of quantum chemistry calculation and vapor phase spectroscopy in recent years, it has been found that also in nucleic acid base pairs, stacking interaction in which aromatic rings overlap each other due to dispersing force has strength to compete with hydrogen bonding [1, 2]. For this reason, competition between hydrogen bonding and stacking interaction has attracted attention in recent years.

									<p>　The phenolic molecule covered in this study is a molecule which can bond together hydrogen bond by OH group and stacking interaction by aromatic ring in one molecule. Ar atoms are also known to be able to accept both interactions. Therefore, the phenol-Ar cluster can be said to be the smallest basic system to study the competition of both. In the neutral state, the dispersion force becomes the main interaction between phenol and Ar, so Ar atoms are bonded on the aromatic ring and take a π-bound structure. On the other hand, in phenol cation, the hydrogen bond strength by OH group increases, and it has been found that H-bound structure where Ar atom is bonded to the tip of OH group is the most stable structure (Fig. 1) [3].</p>

							<p>These structural changes are most sensitive to OH stretching vibration. In case of phenol cation , OH stretching vibration appears at the same 3537 cm <sup>-1</sup>as phenol simple substance if Ar is p-bonded with aromatic ring, so if the Ar atom is ahead of the OH group OH stretching vibration decreases to 3467 cm <sup>-1</sup>due to hydrogen bonding . Therefore, by catching this change, we can know the bonding position of Ar atoms.</p>

									<p>By applying UV - UV - IR picosecond time - resolved infrared spectroscopy to phenol - Ar<sub>2</sub>clusters, Ar atoms bonded to aromatic rings are converted to OH groups I succeeded in observing how it moves to the tip in real time from moment to moment. By photoionization of the phenol-Ar <sub>2</sub>cluster, a metastable cation cluster with Ar atoms bound on the aromatic ring is generated by Franck-Condon principle. However, since the hydrogen bond is more stable in the ionic state, Ar atoms move to the hydrogen bond zone. Figure 2 shows the infrared spectrum measured at 1.5 picosecond intervals from ionization. Immediately after ionization, OH stretching vibration was observed at the same 3537 cm <sup>-1</sup>as phenol cation alone, but it was found that it decreased to 3467 cm<sup>-1</sup>of the hydrogen bond that is the most stable structure at the lifetime of 7 picoseconds I will. This is due to the fact that the intensity of stacking interaction (π-bonding) due to competing aromatic rings and hydrogen bond (H-bonding) due to OH group is switched by ionization, and ionization induced site switching It suggests the possibility of control of action. Currently, we are conducting research on various molecules and solvents, aiming at elucidating reactions in more complicated systems.</p>
