						<p> Although substances form a hierarchical structure from a single molecule to a cell, the current frontier of chemistry can be said to be in the elucidation and creation of the functions of complex systems. The essence of a complex system with a high function typified by a biomolecule system is that it has a large internal degree of freedom and that the system flexibly changes according to the situation and develops the optimum function. We define a complex molecular system with such characteristics as "soft molecular system" and conduct research that integrates molecular science, biophysics, synthetic chemistry, theory and computational science towards understanding and control of its function I will. Specifically, we conduct a research that combines the soft molecular system typified by biomolecules, supramolecules, molecular aggregates, interfaces, etc. and its element processes with the three approaches of theoretical calculation, advanced measurement, and function creation , We will create a new academic field of "molecular science" for complex systems. </ p>

						<p>Molecules having both dispersion force sites (aromatic rings) and hydrogen bonding sites (OH, NH groups) are often found in bio-related molecules such as DNA and neurotransmitters, and molecular recognition found in all physiological phenomena It is deeply involved with the organization. Considering the hydrogen bonding force and the dispersing power at the same time, which site the ligand or solvent coordinates to in the kind of molecule, environment, electronic state etc, what kind of change will change the binding site (molecular switching) Is considered to be very important as a clue to essentially understand such a molecular recognition mechanism. In this study, complementary experimental groups in three countries: electron beam impact spectroscopy (EI) group (Germany), ultrahigh resolution photoelectron spectroscopy (ZEKE) group (UK), time resolved infrared spectroscopy (TR group We aim to organize and collaborate, establish understanding of the molecular recognition system from the understanding of intermolecular interactions, and also to control the induced dynamics. <br />
							We accepted young researchers from Munich Technical University in Germany, University of Manchester, UK and conduct joint research and also dispatched researchers from Assistant Professors and doctoral researchers / graduate students in pairs from Japan side for 2 weeks in 4 weeks unit We will promote collaborative research. In addition to collaborative research, it also features seminars not only in Japan but also in Germany and the UK, and gives young researchers the opportunity to speak and discuss in English.</p>

"Accuracy improvement of the origin and history of cross-border contaminated fine particles by advanced single-grain internal structure analyzer"</p>
						<br />
						<p>As the emission of air pollutants is rapidly increasing due to economic development in East Asia such as China, there is concern about transboundary air pollution from the continent to Japan. Particularly, PM particulate matter PM <sub> 2.5 </ sub> floats long distances, so highly accurate evaluation of transboundary contamination is required. In this research, we apply state-of-the-art single particle internal structure analyzer to transboundary fine particles and image internal chemical composition distribution. By distinguishing the origin of the particle by using the source at the center and the distribution of the floating components at the periphery and linking this with the conventional observation method, it is possible to clarify the origin and history elucidation of cross- It is aimed at developing precise new methods.</p>

"Study on hazardous organic matter real time evaluation method in automobile exhaust gas by portable laser ionization analyzer"</p>
						<br />
						<p>There are chemical species harmful to the human body even in trace amounts in hydrocarbon (HC) discharged from automobiles, and its emission varies depending on the driving situation, but the current regulations remain limited to the total amount of HC. Considering health effects, exhaust gas assessment according to the toxicity of each component, which changes according to the driving situation, is required. However, in the high sensitivity measurement of the exhaust gas component by the existing method, pretreatment such as separation and concentration is necessary, and concentration change of trace components due to operating conditions can not be measured in real time. Therefore, we focused on the laser ionization method which enables molecular selection, high sensitivity, real-time measurement, real-time highly sensitive measurement of trace amounts of hydrocarbons at the laboratory level, but even the measurement technology in the real environment has been reached not here.</p>
						<p>Therefore, in this research, we developed a portable laser ionization analyzer with a practical equipment configuration that can be widely used in general environments, grasp the actual condition of trace harmful components contained in automotive exhaust gas using it, and establish its evaluation method By collaboration of industry, government and academia.</p>

						<p>This project aims to realize a safe and secure living environment by measuring in real time the trace amounts of chemical substances present in the environment. This real-time pretreatment-free high sensitivity analytical technique is realized by supersonic jet laser multi-photon ionization method (Jet-REMPI method) accumulated by laser molecular spectroscopy research. In the Jet-REMPI method, since the laser wavelength is synchronized with the resonance line of the target atom / molecule and only the objective component can be selectively ionized and mass analyzed, it has high detection sensitivity and substance identification ability even when contaminants are present It is a feature.</p>
