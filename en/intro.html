				In the 20th century it is an era of refinement, physics chemistry is not understood as being in a complicated reality system In order to clarify the nature of a molecule simple substance, cryogenic cooling and gas phase supersonic molecular beam,
I think that we have pursued the properties of isolated molecules by making use of laser spectroscopy and others. <br>
Progress in theoretical chemistry / computational chemistry has also become a very powerful method for studying the properties of ideal isolated molecules. <br>
Now that we know the nature of an isolated molecule so far, I think that we should try to understand complex reality systems while promoting understanding of the properties and elementary processes of isolated molecules. <br>
We are actively exploring new methodologies needed for this. <br>

I will briefly introduce two examples of topics below.

					<h3>Ionization induced isomerization reaction</h3>
					<img src="images/intro-fig2.jpg"><br>

					<p>
					This is similar to the most traditional laser spectroscopic research out of Fujii's topics, and it is a study example for molecular clusters. <br>
Molecular clusters are microscopic models of solution / agglomerated phases and are suitable for studying elementary processes. <br>
The phenolic molecule covered here is one of the smallest molecules having a hydrophilic group (hydroxyl group) capable of hydrogen bonding and a hydrophobic group (aromatic ring) interacting by dispersion force. <br>
Clusters of this with argon atoms, in the neutral state the dispersive power is superior and the argon atoms are bonded on the aromatic ring. <br>
						On the other hand, we succeeded in observing the site switching of argon atoms to hydroxyl groups at 7 picoseconds in real time for the first time by increasing the hydrogen bonding power by laser ionization. <br>
The three-wavelength picosecond time-resolved infrared spectroscopy used for this purpose is also the first in the world. <br>
Ionization is a phenomenon which brings about a large change in the properties of molecules and intermolecular interactions due to the appearance of electric charges, and I believe ionization-induced isomerization reactions are also important as elementary process understanding of solvent reorientation by ionization. <br>
In cluster research, we succeeded in demonstrating a new reaction channel that photoexcited aromatic acid reacts neutral radical reaction for the first time.

					<h3>Laser Resonance Multiphoton Ionization (REMPI) - High Efficiency Ionization of Only aimed Molecules in a Mixture </ h3>
<img src = "images / intro-fig5.jpg"> <br>

<p>
Another heterogeneous system conforming to reality is environmental measurement. Especially burning is a familiar and useful phenomenon such as an incinerator and an internal combustion engine, but there are few cases where these phenomena are measured in real time to trace substances in practice what actually happens. <br>
						This is because the sensitivity has been improved by the pretreatment such as concentration and extraction in the conventional analytical chemistry, and a long period such as dioxins and polycyclic aromatic substances and a substance that is harmful to the human body in 2 weeks It is spent only for preprocessing. <br>
We have developed high sensitivity spectroscopy through research on molecules and clusters, and by using this, we solved this problem easily. Specifically, it is a method called resonance multiphoton ionization (REMPI). <br>
This is based on the phenomenon that the ionization efficiency dramatically increases when the absorption band (color) of the substance and the wavelength of the laser to be irradiated coincide. <br>
If you synchronize the laser wavelength to the substance of your interest in the mixture, you can ionize only that substance without any pretreatment. <br>
						Moreover, due to the resonance effect, the actual sensitivity is ultrahigh sensitivity of 50,000 molecules / cm 3. I connected this to an actual trash incinerator and succeeded in detecting benzene chloride, which is a dioxin precursor, in 10 seconds intervals without pretreatment in real time. <br>
Currently, this method is promoted as a development of a history analysis device of fine particles (advanced measurement analysis technology / equipment development project) and laser multi-photon analysis (integrated research institute project) on environment / combustion gas in combination with ion beam.
