					Analysis of historical information of each particle is strongly required for grasping the actual condition of contamination of airborne particulate matter (SPM) and to take countermeasures. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method to combine it with a focused ion beam (FIB) method capable of processing / sputtering at nanoscale by using the resonant multiphoton ionization method (REMPI) which can selectively ionize only a specific molecular species even in mixed samples as an ionization means , We are pursuing development aiming at the realization of a single particle hysteresis analyzer that analyzes the composition of the inner and outer shells of SPM particles characteristic of environmental sites and origins of origin. We introduce the situation in the fields related to this development, the fundamental principle of resonant multiphoton ionization, application examples for high sensitivity analysis, and examples of environmental analysis by focused ion beam, and outline the development concept, current situation and ripple effect.

					　Environmental pollutants are extremely complicated mixtures with diverse origins. As an example of atmospheric airborne particulate matter (SPM), SPM discharged together with exhaust gas from automobiles and combustion engines at the time of occurrence are inorganic and organic harmful substances such as heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic compounds, halogen-containing aromatic compounds and nitrated aromatic compounds It contains substances. Thereafter, it is transferred to the human body, water, soil, living environment through accumulation of SPM particles and chemical reaction on the surface of the particles in the atmosphere, etc., accumulated or decomposed. The occurrence of pollutants associated with human activities occurs in all forms of exhaust gas (gas phase), waste water (aqueous phase), solid waste (solid phase), and mass transfer between these phases also occurs. Therefore, in any step of grasping the actual condition of trace amount of environmental pollutants, planning and implementation of occurrence control measures, verification of effect, dynamic analysis, that is, temporal and spatial refinement of contamination analysis, movement and change of particles themselves Analysis of history is strongly required. In order to realize this, only a small amount of sample is required, and a means capable of analyzing quickly with high accuracy and high sensitivity without pretreatment is indispensable. Sampling of a small amount of sample can be completed within a short time regardless of the location, thus allowing time and space precision analysis of contamination analysis and providing unprecedented information. In addition, since the division of labor is adopted as inorganic substances as ICP / MS and organic substances as GC / MS, efficiency is poor, and correlation between heavy metals and harmful organic substances ・ synergistic toxicity etc. occur in real environment I can not get real information on an event. In addition, in order to accurately ascertain the cause of contamination, it is indispensable to have a method of clarifying the occurrence / migration history of characteristic particulates representing the source on a particle basis.

						The analysis needs of the above trace environmental pollutants are summarized in the following points


						<li>A multicomponent rapid analyzer capable of simultaneous analysis of multiple harmful substances without requiring a very small amount of sample and without pretreatment.
</li>

						For example, it is a system that can analyze the mg SPM particles that can be collected from the atmosphere in a few minutes and can grasp the overall picture of the environmental field.

						<li>Focusing on particles of specific compositions and specific shapes, we can elucidate the whole volume by distinguishing one particle from the surface and the interior, and diagnose particle generation process and floating history.

					　Methods for individually analyzing existing environmental particulates include electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) method [1], aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) method [2], time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF - SIMS) Method, etc. have been reported, but all of them are both merit and short, and no historical analysis has been realized at all.


					　Since the EPMA method is a non-destructive analysis and the generation region of X rays in a solid is 1 μm or more, the average composition of a sample of 1 μ microns can be easily known and the concentration of suspended particulate matter (SPM) It can be applied to origin analysis. By using EDX as a spectroscope, the measurement time per point can be several minutes short enough, so it is easy to comparatively measure multiple samples such as aging at the same point and simultaneous multipoint analysis. However, since information obtained is only elemental composition, information on organic matter can not be obtained. Also, local analysis can not be performed in a region smaller than 1 μm, and sensitivity is lower than mass spectrometry, so it is difficult to detect extremely minor components for small particles of the order of 0.1 μm, such as diesel exhaust gas particles is there.


					　Since aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) uses mass spectrometry, it can be applied to both inorganic materials and organic materials, and at the same time it is possible to acquire particle size information of particles. An example of real-time particle size measurement and composition analysis of fly ash generated from an incineration facility has been reported. For ionization methods essential for mass spectrometry, electron bombardment methods and laser light are often used. However, in the case of the AMS method, it can be applied only to volatile components of particle constituent substances. Furthermore, it is not possible to distinguish between the surface and the inside of individual particles and analyze them.

				<div class="col-md-8">
				　If it is possible to analyze both inorganic and organic substances by distinguishing the inside and the outside of one SPM particle as described above, it is possible to clarify the generation history of fine particles and the causal relation between the organic matter formed on the surface and the inner shell inorganic substance . FIB (focused ion beam) is an excellent nanofabrication / analysis method with a spatial resolution of several nm, and it is possible to acquire both surface and internal information by performing cross-sectional microfabrication of one particle of several tens of nanometers (See the previous page photo, particles are fine particles derived from thermal power plant, diameter 30 micrometers).

				On the other hand, when using FIB alone, a problem is the insufficient sensitivity due to the low secondary ion generation rate and the complication of molecular identification including generation of fragments. Therefore, in this development item, we developed the FIB nano-sampling-REMPI method that achieves high sensitivity and substance selectivity by laser multiphoton resonance ionization of neutral species (atoms / organic molecules) generated by FIB nanosampling, Realize single particle historical analysis device

Furthermore, incorporating a company that is a heavy user of environmental analysis and a comprehensive analytical equipment maker specializing in user-friendly systemization of equipment as a result of prototype evaluation and practical application is indispensable, we formed a team that takes this into consideration.

						　Development items are<br>
roughly divided into 1) FIB nanosampling - REMPI method combined with this 2) resonance multiphoton ionization spectroscopy with environmental analysis in mind. The state of neutral particles emitted by ion beam sputtering including focused ion beam (FIB) has not been sufficiently studied so far. Therefore, (1) an FIB nanosampling team that develops a pulse FIB nanosampling apparatus in advance and (2) a SIMS-REMPI method development group that performs REMPI detection of sputtered atoms and molecules, and (3) a laser spectroscopy team To organically work together to develop the FIB - REMPI method smoothly, we are realizing a single - particle historical analysis device. We designed the equipment in FY 2004 and carried out the fabrication of FIB-REMPI equipment and the development of the elemental technology related to it in FY 2005. The FIB-REMPI signal has already been obtained, and this year we are optimizing the elemental technology obtained.
